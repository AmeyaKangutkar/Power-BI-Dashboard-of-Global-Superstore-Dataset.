# Power-BI-Dashboard-of-Global-Superstore-Dataset.
The dashboard is based on the Global Superstore Dataset, which contains a comprehensive set of data about the company's sales and operations, including information about sales by region, product category, and customer segment, as well as data on shipping costs, profits, and inventory levels.
The Power BI Dashboard of the Global Superstore Dataset is made up of multiple visualizations and widgets, including bar charts, pie charts, line charts, and maps, that display the data in a clear and intuitive manner. The dashboard is highly interactive and allows users to drill down into the data by selecting different regions, product categories, or time periods. This allows decision-makers to gain a deeper understanding of the sales trends and patterns and to identify areas of improvement.
